Super Hamster Ball

My animation was inspired by Super Monkey Ball and Super Mario Bros. I wanted to make a 3D platform game but unfortunately, I was unable to get the collisions working properly. Eventually, my plan broadened to show some of the things that hamsters love such as sunflowers, cheese, and of course, their exercise balls. Nevertheless, the ball moves correctly in the x and z directions as well as up in the y-direction. Most of the instructions on how to interact with the world are on the bottom of the index.html page.

Requirements fulfilled: 
Two-level hierarchical object: sunflower
